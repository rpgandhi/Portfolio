    <h3>Howdy and thanks for visiting my page!</h3>
    <p> I live in the PNW which is usually beautiful but is currently overrun with smoke from burning <em>wildfiires</em>. <strong>Yikes!</strong> People that live here generally try to make the most of their summers because they're beautful and also because it rains the rest of the year! I'm no exception. I've had a busy summer indeed. Here a few of the highlights:
      <ul>
        <li>Taking a road trip to the Redwoods in California</li>
        <li>Spending a week at the coast</li>
        <li>Dispersed camping around Mt. St. Helens</li>
        <li>Visiting the Oregon Caves National Monument</li>
        <li>Camping at Timothy Lake on Mt. Hood</li>
        <li>Paddle boarding on the Columbia River</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>A little more about me:</h3>

    <p>I have a darling 6 year old daughter and equally as darling long-haired chihuhua who will soon be 12. These two characters are my favorite cuddle creatures and adventure buddies. Aside from chillaxing at home with my favorite duo, these are some of the things I enjoy:
      <ul>
        <li>Dispersed camping <em>(Have you tried it? No lights, no toilets, no neighbors; it's the best. Just you, your gear, and the great outdoors!)</em></li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Biking</li>
        <li>SUPing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Eating <em>(I'm always on the hunt for a new place to try)</em></li>
        <li>Sleeping</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
